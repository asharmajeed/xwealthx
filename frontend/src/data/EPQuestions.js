Q 31.
1. Answer: B 
Even if only one of the spouses is an income earner, it is presumed that the efforts of the  nonworking spouse contributed to the benefit of the marital property. 
2. Answer: D 
Only long-term gain type property will get a step-up in gain. Answers I, II, and IV are all ordinary  income type property. 
3. Answer: C 
Answer A is incorrect. It will not be subject to probate. If Answer C happens, which it could,  then the property would get a full step-up in basis. JTWROS transfers by operation of law. This  is not necessarily a disadvantage. 
4. Answer: A 
Answers B, C, and D are advantages. Answer A is a disadvantage because of the restriction  placed on the joint owners (husband and wife only). 
5. Answer: A 
Answer D is subject to probate, but not ancillary probate. Answer B passed by operation of law. Answer C is referring to personal property not real estate. 
6. Answer: C 
A charity (including a private university) and a donee in a lower tax bracket are the best  answers. 
7. Answer: C 
A 2503(b) trust is a gift of a future interest. 
8. Answer: E 
There is no change in basis as the stock is gifted from generation to generation. Her son's basis  will be $100,000. The gain is $700,000 ($800,000 - $100,000). 
9. Answer: C 
Answer A is not a completed gift. The transfer of a personal check is not complete until it is paid  by the drawee. Causa Mortis is a gift conditional upon the donor's dying. It is incomplete as  long as the donor is alive. In a revocable joint bank account, the donor retains the power to  revoke the gift.

18. Answer: A 
Because it is a simple trust, income only, it is a gift of a future interest. 
19. Answer: C 
The other choices have no 5% requirement. 
20. Answer: C 
A wealth replacement trust is just a fancy name for an ILIT.

22. Answer: C 
A recap is considered a freezing technique. 
23. Answer: D

24. Answer: C 
Per definition. 
25. Answer: B
