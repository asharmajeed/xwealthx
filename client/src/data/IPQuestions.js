Question 2 : C
He actually bought $10,000 of PDG for $5,000 (50% margin). $5,000 was borrowed on margin. The interest was
$150. $5,000 x 12% x 1/4 = $150
HPR = ($15,000 - ($5,000 + $150) - $5,000) / $5,000 = 97%
The first ($5,000 + $150) is to pay back the borrowed funds plus interest. The $5,000 is his initial investment.
